Purpose:
--------
The main purpose of this program is to create a game of tic tac toe that can be played by two players. 

Important components: 
---------------------
The grid was initialized using a 2D list and many functions were created and used.

### Enhancement: Color and Optional 3rd Player 
The program will print out each player's chosen in a different color for distinction and will ask the user if they would like to play with 3 players. The program will the adjust accordingly to 3 players.

Usage
-----
Run the program from a command line by CDing into the project directory an executing:
`python ticTacToe.py`

The program will then ask you if you would like to play with 2 or 3 players, ask for each to choose a symbol, choose a random order for who gets to start, and then runs with game back and forth until a winner is found or there is a tie.
